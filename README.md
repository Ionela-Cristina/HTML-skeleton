# HTML-skeleton STARTS HERE!

Let's put the foot in the door!

To define the structure of a web page first, I have to create the skeleton then I can add more to it.
In a perfect world the skeleton is just a skeleton isn't?
But we need more!

We need CSS/Makeup to give colors to the page and JavaScript to make them alive and interactive or we may need Pyton if we want to add machine learning, data visualisation or data analysis.
